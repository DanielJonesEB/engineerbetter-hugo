Hello dear Concourse-Up users!</br>
We have exciting news to share with you: Concourse-up has changed name!</br>
Introducing...ü•Å **Control-Tower for Concourse**! üéâ


## Change is the only constant...

You probably have noticed that Control-Tower has been through [exciting changes](http://www.engineerbetter.com/blog/concourse-up-gcp/) over the last few months, and this is another stepping stone in the life of our product.
We approach the development of Control-Tower in an Agile way, with various goals for our product; we embrace change, as it is the only constant..


## What else is new?

Excitingly, Control-Tower supports deployments using the latest version of Concourse, that has been recently released [(5.0)](https://concourse-ci.org/download.html).

As well as AWS, Control-Tower supports deployments on GCP as of recently. We are now moving towards a more 'IaaS agnostic' product with the introduction of a new feature: an `--iaas` flag that requires users to choose between the two IaaSes that we currently support, for the sake of parity.


## What's next?

A new name for our product means intricate changes from a technical standpoint.
This project will be ongoing at the time of the publication of this post. Our team of engineers is working on ensuring a smooth transition from Concourse-Up to Control Tower, on all levels (especially for existing Concourse-Up deployments to Control-Tower).
The new name is only the beginning of this period of change, so watch this space!



Thanks for reading, we hope that you are as excited as we are!</br>
