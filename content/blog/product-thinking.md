Agile can help us deliver software quickly. Product thinking is what allows us to deliver _useful_ software.

## What is product thinking?

We'll use the term _product thinking_ here to reflect that there are design and organisational elements to delivering products beyond that which might be considered purely product management.

Product thinking is a set of processes to **identify, understand and prioritise problems** faced by a known set of **customers**, and then systematically **build and validate solutions** that are expected to have an **ongoing lifespan**.

**Product thinking is in contrast to project execution** which assumes that there will one day be a 'finished' state, and in which success is determined not by checking that the world changed in a desired and meaningful way, but instead by meeting a fixed set of requirements by a given date and within a given budget (the ['iron triangle'](/blog/escaping-iron-triangle))

> Executives: Oh... We've never thought of that.

## Themes of product thinking

There are four core themes of product thinking that we'll explain in more detail:

* Problem validation
* Ruthless prioritisation
* Well-defined and measurable success
* Customer empathy

These don't just apply at one level of an organisation - rather, they're like a [stick of rock](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rock_(confectionery)) in that they run vertically throughout an organisation at all levels.

### Problem validation

_Focus on the problem before the solution_

When a doctor diagnoses a patient, they spend a good amount of time triaging to ensure that they very confidently understand what may be causing the patient their pain. The doctor will run tests as well as collect anecdotal evidence from the patient themselves, quantitative and qualitative data, and research. Only after they fully understand and can provide concrete evidence of their patient's problem will they determine the diagnosis and propose a treatment (or solution).

Implementing a product mindset works similarly in focusing on a problem first and making sure that you fully understand and can justify it before diagnosing a potential solution.

### Ruthless prioritisation

_Address the riskiest assumptions first_

Following the same example, a patient may go see a doctor with several issues. The doctor will assess the patient and then do their best to determine which single issue is posing the greatest risk to their patient's welfare. This will most likely be the first concern that they will focus on and address.

Fixing the most important thing first means the doctor still has a patient to continue working with - there's little point addressing someone's asthma if they're bleeding to death.

One should make the biggest pains clear and prioritise what will be the most valuable and impactful to the customer, and do so ruthlessly. By doing this the overall risk is smaller and effort won't be wasted treating the wrong things.

### Well-defined & measurable success

_When you know what success looks like, you know when you're done and what to do next_

Product thinking provides a way to test and measure outcomes to ensure you return significant results, regardless of whether they are positive or negative. The worst situation that a doctor can be in is one where they run a test and the results are inconclusive. If the conditions of the test are not clear, variances have not been accounted for before starting, or the doctor is not sure what they are even testing for, any results that are returned are fairly useless to their ability to diagnose and treat their patient. Additionally, it's important to reiterate that the success of the test is determined by ensuring that regardless of the result, there is enough information to make informed decisions about what to do next.

### Customer empathy

Product thinking aids in creating empathy for users and an emphasis is placed on the importance of delivering value that is owned and understood by the entire team. This provides a sense of purpose and also an insight for the team into how their efforts directly impact the things they are producing, making for more commercially intelligent teams. Empowering teams to have the courage to ask why they're building and invest and take ownership in outcomes as opposed to outputs.

## Why is product thinking important?

Product thinking is important as the next frontier in building useful software, and in creating resilient organisations.

Agile software delivery is a largely stagnant field - for years at EngineerBetter we've been helping people delivery software more quickly. Cloud native practices allow us to create resilient and highly-available systems on global scales. Both are generally well-understood even if adoption is poor and lip-service is prevalent.

Neither agile nor cloud native help us to build software that is useful and that changes the world in the intended fashion.  In short, they don't help us build _the right thing_.

It is only by explicitly identifying those suffering a problem, understanding the issue, hypothesising what might help, building it, and then checking that it had the intended effect that we deliver useful software.

We've also observed that many in our industry spend so much time focusing on the tech and the solution, that they haven't done enough to determine if the solution matches or solves the problem for their users in the first place. It's often forgotten that at the heart of technological advances, we're ultimately trying to solve problems for people and add more value to their lives! When thinking about what success looks like, it's important that we're measuring the right things (or even taking measurements in the first place).

Agile can help you go as fast as you like, but if you're building the wrong thing, you're screwed anyway - no one will use what you build and chances are, a great deal of waste will be created in the process.

If Agile is the vehicle you are traveling in, then product thinking is the GPS navigation ensuring that you're tracking in the right direction on your journey. Product thinking captures, and holds teams accountable to justifying, the intent of their actions. In a space where work is justified and actions are intentional, less waste will occur.

> ### A cautionary tale
> EngineerBetter worked with a CTO who asked for help creating an effective software delivery practice and technology culture. Whilst performing this consultancy work, it became clear that the business was a **'feature factory'** - the visionary CEO, who had willed this first-of-its-kind product into existence, was still dictating which features needed to be built. There were no success criteria associated with these features, nor any attempt to check that they were having a positive effect. If he woke up one morning with a new idea, it was suddenly the company's top priority.
>
> We identified this as a risk and implored the CTO to allow us to engage with the CEO to perform some executive coaching. The CEO needed to know that he had 'levelled up' and was no longer building a product, but instead _building the company_ that built the product. He needed to delegate product decisions to professionals, and most importantly **validate that features had the desired outcomes**. Without this, all the agility in the world would only help them deliver the wrong thing.
>
> Our requests were repeatedly declined. "He's not ready for that yet", "we need to make improvements first before having that conversation." We should have done a better job of convincing the customer that we could help.
>
> Some months later, the CEO made a unilateral and fundamental **change to the product without checking that it was what customers actually wanted**. Customers felt cheated, left in their droves, and started a downward spiral that (combined with the COVID-19 pandemic) **resulted in the company becoming insolvent**.
>
> Product thinking makes each feature a bet - _if we spend X building Y, then we think we'll see effect Z_.
>
> An organisation without product thinking turns itself into the bet - _we'll build whatever we think is the right thing, and if we're wrong, we'll go bust._

## Who should apply product thinking?

Anyone that is building a product or offers a service can benefit from product thinking and associated tools and practices. The greater the uncertainty in the problem, solution, or delivery method, the greater the benefits of applying product thinking.

Product thinking applies to anything that offers self-service with an ongoing lifespan. Digital experiences, apps, platforms, as well as abstract systems such as communication loops, services and information flows could all leverage these techniques.

The product mindset is a fundamental shift that is occurring in IT service teams (eg the network team) as Infrastructure-as-Code and automation become more prevalent. Instead of _do the thing because you were asked to_-style toil, teams are building automation products that provide their customers self-service.
