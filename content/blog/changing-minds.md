Using the [model of mindset change documented](https://www.amazon.co.uk/Changing-Minds-Science-Peoples-Leadership/dp/1422103293) by [Howard Gardner](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Howard_Gardner), a Harvard psychology professor, can increase the chance of cultural change within individuals, teams and organisations. All too often technologists, consultants and agile coaches miss part of the wider picture. Gardner's model helps us identify blind spots, so that we can address them.

Before going into the details of the model, I'd say that those of us trying to change the culture of an organisation would do well to consider the following points:

* Ensure **ideas are represented in multiple ways**. The more ways you can present an idea and have it ring true, the less internal conflict the audience will have.
* Leverage **all the factors/levers of change** in Gardner's model. Technologists have a tendency to rely purely on reason alone, which isn't enough given that humans aren't strictly rational beings.
* **Be conscious of which scale** you're working at and which tools you should be using. Ensure you're working at all required scales.

Gardner's model consists of **entities** (things that exist in the mind), **scales** at which mind change can occur, and **factors** that folks take into account when shifting their beliefs. By considering cultural change along these axes we can identify where our arguments may need bolstering, and how ideas could be communicated differently.

* Entities
    * Concepts
    * Theories/models
    * Stories
    * Skills
* Scales
    * Large heterogeneous
    * Large homogeneous
    * Indirectly
    * Formal setting (education)
    * Family
    * Individual
* Factors
    * Reason
    * Research
    * Resonance
    * Representational redescriptions
    * Resources/rewards
    * Real-world events
    * Resistance

Gardner does not claim that his model is exhaustive, rather the contrary. In my view a notable omission from his list of entities of the mind are beliefs or value judgements about a thing, such as _"X is bad"_ or, _"I'm a member of this group, we don't do Y"_.

## Scales

These largely speak for themselves, so I shalln't expand upon each of them. Different tools and techniques are needed to work at different scales.

**At larger scales, art and technology can effect change** - think of influential musicians, artistic movements. In the realm of continuous delivery, **consider how Docker changed people's attitudes towards DevOps**.

**Simple stories work better than complex ones at large scales** Consider the simplicity of the political messaging that appears to be winning popular votes around the world.

There is interdependence between the adjacent levels of scale. Changing an individual's mind on a matter is going to be a darn sight easier if their team/friends/family are also on-board with the idea. Changing a team's mindset is going to be easier if individuals are bought-in, and if the wider organisation is.

## Entities

### Concepts

Concepts in the sense of Gardner's model are ideas or notions, and best demonstrated by examples. Test-driven development is a concept. Continuous delivery is a concept. 'Cat' is a concept. Concepts are concepts! Concepts are lodged into people's minds by awareness-raising: informing them of something that they didn't know existed before.

### Theories

In this context, theories are mental models of "if this, then that". Interestingly this category includes the notion of counterfactuals, or the idea that human intelligence has sufficiently sophisticated models of the world that we can pose the question _"what if that_ didn't _happen"_, which is an area that artificial intelligence struggles with.

### Stories

It's remarkable how influenced by stories humans are. My father was a press photographer, and I remember him pointing out that _"there's got to be a story"_ in a news article. It wasn't enough to present the facts; folks want to know about the people involved and the journey they went on. We remember things better when they're part of a narrative; we're emotionally affected by stories.

We tell stories to our children; we consume stories on TV and film; we tell stories at the water-cooler; we read stories in the form of case studies; we dream of stories at night.

### Skills

Skills represent the brains' ability to make the body do a practical task. Consider the difference between knowing about a thing (concept) and being able to do it (skill). One can attend a seminar on eXtreme Programming, but being a good pair-programmer takes practice and self-awareness. Having taught martial arts during the peak of Internet forum culture, I can tell you there's a world of difference between knowing facts about an activity and being able to _do_ it.

## Factors

In this area of his model, Gardner insists on alliteration that I think undermines one's ability to understand the model clearly. I'm guessing he thought it would either lead to more resonance or be easier to remember. I find it anything but; then again I'm not a Harvard professor.

### Reason

Simply put: logical arguments. Is the idea internally consistent? Does it hold up to rational scrutiny?

### Research

If the 'reason' factor represents a logical model, then the 'research' factor represents an audience's desire to seek validation of the model. This might be by seeking data from others, or by testing the model themselves.

### Resonance

The importance of emotional resonance is often under-rated or ignored by technologists. By contrast the livelihoods of marketers and user experience designers depend very much on it. In the era of fake news, we're sadly all too familiar with the notion that information doesn't need to be true, it just needs to _feel_ true. The most sound logical argument is likely to effect change if an audience is emotionally disengaged from it.

### Representational Redescriptions

Can the idea be represented in different ways, and still ring true? _Has_ it been represented in different ways? How many ways can the idea be considered and still seem sound?

### Resources/Rewards

Is there a reward to this new proposed idea? Am I going to earn more money? Will I get a promotion? Or, by contrast, is my pension at risk? This sort of extrinsic motivator can be enough to change the behaviour of some people for a time, but often results on cognitive dissonance. I'm sure we're all familiar with folks who are happy to do something they don't believe in, as long as it makes them money. These aren't really positions that are truly assimilated into the beliefs of the individual - they're excuses used to justify behaviour. This lever on its own is unlikely to effect genuine, long-standing mindset change.

### Real World Events

This factor represents the context wider than the mindset change in question. How many political movements have been tipped by a pivotal event at a crucial moment?

### Resistance

Not all factors are conducive to mindset change, and people are to different degrees resistant to new ideas. If these new ideas conflict with habits and autonomous behaviours of the individual, then even if they are consciously supportive of the new regime, they will experience emotional distress. The conscious mind narrates the activity of its host after the fact. Finding a conflict between subconscious behaviour and rational ideals, forces a justification of those actions which can pan out one of two ways: _I'm wrong_ or _this idea is wrong_. One of those carries a much higher emotional cost.

It's also worth talking about the [phenomenon of reactance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reactance_(psychology)): resisting any idea or proposal that limits the freedoms of the individual. Lives have been sacrificed and wars have been fought for the sake of freedom, so it's little wonder that any idea that reduces the agency of the individual will be met with hostility.

## Multiple Intelligences

Gardner's approach dovetails with his [theory of multiple intelligences](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_multiple_intelligences), which suggests in essence that humans have multiple bits of psychological machinery with which to consider the world:

* Linguistic
* Logical-mathematical
* Musical
* Spatial
* Bodily-kinesthetic
* Naturalist
* Interpersonal
* Intrapersonal
* Existential

The idea should not be conflated with the repeatedly-refuted idea of [learning styles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Learning_styles). The theory of multiple intelligences is not without its critics, and it remains to be seen how well the idea maps onto empirical findings of cognitive neuroscience (the current answer is 'not very well').

For our purposes, the theory of multiple intelligences serves as a useful framework, regardless of the underlying mechanisms, to consider that folks can interpret the same issue in a multitude of ways. Much as sales techniques like [SPIN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neil_Rackham#SPIN_Selling) don't map to any specific neurological model, we don't need a proven mechanical relationship of causality in order to find use in a mental tool.
