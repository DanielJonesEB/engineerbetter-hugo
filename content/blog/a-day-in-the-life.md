9:0something - I get myself to the office, grab myself a hot breakfast and a coffee just in time to join the Pivotal standup at 9:06 and keep updated on any events and general goings on around the office. One standup down.

9:15 - I make my way to my desk, finish off any remaining breakfast and fight with my bluetooth for 5 minutes until they're playing nicely with my laptop.

9:30 - Our daily team standup starts.  My current client has a distributed team across three timezones, so  our daily schedule is pretty interesting. The format of this meeting is basically 'what were you working on, are you blocked on anything, what will you be working on today'. We try to keep these sessions as short as possible so as not to take up too much engineering time. We finish by allocating pairs and user stories for today. Second stand-up down.

9:38 - Today I'm working on _______. I dial in to a video call with my pairing partner and quickly run through the latest commits and story comments in our team tracker, before kicking off our remote pairing session. We work together (taking intermittent snack breaks) until London lunch time.

13:30 - We make sure we've committed all of our changes, and documented our progress via tracker comments. I head upstairs and test the limits of the free snacks. 

14:30 - Today is a Thursday, which means it's retro time. Our whole team (UK, US, India) dials in for a remote meeting reflecting on the things we feel went well, not so well, and the things we're wondering about this week. For this we use [Postfacto](https://github.com/pivotal/postfacto#targetText=Postfacto%20is%20a%20free%2C%20open,aimed%20at%20helping%20remote%20teams.). Each team member is free to post as many comments as they'd like under each heading, and upvote any other comments that they agree with.

14:35 - After allowing a few minutes to post comments. Our PM (Product Manager) kicks off the retro, going through each of the comments inviting the author to talk through their comments and facilitating any additional discussion. Any opportunities to be agile and improve on our working practices are logged as action points.

15:30 - Third standup of the day with our engineer in the US.
