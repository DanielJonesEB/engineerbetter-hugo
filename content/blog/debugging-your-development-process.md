By debugging your development process instead of your technology, you can get changes into production more quickly, safely and often. By performance-tuning your organisation, you can be more productive without having to increase headcount. In this post we'll explain the Organisational Healthcheck service that EngineerBetter offers, and how it can help you to achieve better outcomes.

EngineerBetter have worked with developers, Development Managers, and CTOs to help software delivery in a number of ways. The service scales from helping individual teams over a few days, to helping continent-spanning departments over weeks and months.

We've helped global corporations address poor lead-time-to-production and low staff morale. We've also helped experienced tech leaders in new positions and new organisations by holding a mirror up to their departments, identifying the practices that they should double-down on whilst also pointing out previously unidentified improvements.

This process isn't a maturity model, or a bunch of tickboxes. With each and every customer we take the time to understand their people, processes and products in great detail. We involve their staff in the journey, and guide them to discover and implement the solutions that only they, as subject-matter experts, can identify.

Over the course of this post, we'll talk about some of the tools we use from Liberating Structures and Systems Thinking, and give examples from customer case studies.

## Steps in the Development Reality Check

We'll briefly go over each of the common steps in the process, before talking about them in more detail.

Customers invite us in to perform detail fact-finding exercises, so that we can truly understand how development here works - not how it _should_ work, but how it _actually_ works. A key component of this is individual **interviews with staff**: engineers, testers, product managers, project managers, leaders, and anyone else we can get our hands on.

As well as speaking to individuals in private, it's vitally important that we use **group facilitation** techniques to crowd-source the details of problems and solutions in a fun and engaging way. This approach has **significant benefits to staff engagement** that should not be underestimated, and will be explained in more detail later.

Once we've found out as much as we can, our engineering consultants go back to carefully construct a **Current Reality Tree** (CRT). This causal diagram is like '5 Whys' on steroids - it maps out undesired symptoms, the chain of intermediate causes, and root causes of these problems. The CRT is an invaluable tool in understanding not only the state of the development process as it stands, but also the inter-relatedness of the issues. Most importantly, it presents the issues in context so that the customer can clearly see which remedies are quick and temporary fixes, and which are large but permanent solutions.

Whilst the CRT is the heart of understanding the organisation we're helping, a traditional **report is produced** to provide a narrative to the model, along with a description of each of the problems and causes, and most importantly a **full set of remedies**. We pride ourselves on identifying as many remedies as possible, in order to give the customer choice. We can't possibly help with all of them, and we see it as a matter of credibility that we'll recommend things that we can't help with. Almost all remedies will require the customers' engagement, and some remedies are actionable by the customer alone.
