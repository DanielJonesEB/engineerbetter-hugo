We're looking for people to **join the EngineerBetter team**.

Specifically we're looking to hire for two streams of work, so we have two profiles we're looking for:

* **Golang developers** with **Google Cloud** infrastructure experience
* Platform engineers with prior **experience of Concourse, CF, BOSH**, Terraform, and ideally able to do TDD in Golang or Ruby

Whilst we've got general background info on our <a href="/join-our-team/">Join Us</a> page, this post will give a bit more detail about the streams of work we're looking at.

As with most of our work, it'll be **based in London** with _some_ scope for **remote work**, and will involve **pair-programming** around 80% of the time.

Whilst in the past we've hired for consultancy work that will require some amount of travel and variability of tasks, we've got enough lined up that for the first time **travel _won't_ be a requirement**.

Of course, we'll still be doing consultancy too, so if you _do_ enjoying visiting European cities during the working week, we can definitely provide that experience! And you could switch between these. One of the benefits of a small company is we can shape roles to individuals' needs, and try to match you up with the work you most enjoy.

There's also the possibility looming of **delivering more training**. We're passionate that instructors should be practitioners, so if you're interested in doing more than just engineering, we should have some work for you.

## Golang/Google Cloud work

Are you a Golang developer? Do you like Terraforming things in Google Cloud? Heck, do you like automating _all the things_?

* Implementing features from an ordered backlog on a number of **Golang** projects that integrate **Google Cloud** services with Cloud Foundry and BOSH.
* Maintaining and possibly creating new **Google Cloud Service Broker** implementations using Terraform.
* Writing code **test-first**, and maintaining and extending **CI/CD Concourse pipelines** to ensure rigorous software quality.
* **Pair-programming** around 80% of the time.
* Monitoring technical debt in the projects, surfacing this through chores in the backlog, and through agile retrospectives.
* Engaging with the Cloud Foundry and BOSH communities to understand their ongoing needs.

## Platform Automation work

Do you already have Cloud Foundry experience? Are you in a position where your knowledge isn't being exploited, perhaps because of enterprise bureaucracy? Would you like the chance to have more varied work? Again, we'd like to start a conversation with you.

* Implementing features from an ordered backlog to build a ‘platform-as-a-product’ for a major customer, using **GitOps** to deploy infrastructure.
* Writing **Concourse** CI pipelines, **Terraform**, custom **Golang**, Bash scripts, **BOSH** releases, Helm charts, and **Kubernetes operators** to idempotently and reproducibly deploy and keep up-to-date installations of Pivotal PCF, PKS (Kubernetes) and associated services.
* Work as part of a team, **pair-programming** around 80% of the time.
* Remote-pair with overseas customer engineers, **educating and upskilling** them.
* Mentoring local staff, promoting modern working methods (GitOps, DevOps, Site Reliability Engineering)
* Monitoring technical debt in the projects, surfacing this through chores in the backlog, and through agile retrospectives.
