I have started my journey as a Product Manager just over a year ago.
That first year has been a collection of moments that I’m really grateful for.

- I have been part of a customer engagement with one of our clients (my first one!). Being a Product Manager in the context of consulting work has been the occasion to learn many lessons, on various levels.

- After that project, I have spent a few weeks shadowing some of my fellow PMs at Pivotal. It brought me a fresh perspective on what I had internalised as a young PM.

The combination of these experiences made me see that a few of my practices had now become areas of improvement.
One of them stood out in particular: the user story……


### User stories and backlog ###
I see the backlog as the skeleton of a product, and the user stories are to me the vertebrae to this structure; they help articulate our high level vision, they give it more life.
It is a channel of communication:
- it builds the essential, shared understanding needed between the PM and the engineers
- it is a vector of transparency: each story is a window into the product, that stakeholders and people outside of the core team can open at any time.


### Structure ###
I have noticed some key elements of a structure that I believe can be reused for most stories

- The “Why”:
	It is important to put it at the top. It is the value statement of the story, the reason behind why the story exists, and the solution it will bring.
	It puts the persona first, the end user

-  The use of scenarios:
	I have noticed that


### Around the story ###
At EngineerBetter, we are Agile to the core. We use the IPMs as a dedicated space to finalise stories collectively.
The discussions ignited during these scrum rituals are a way to ensure that the whole team (PM, engineers,…) is on the same page.
Writing stories takes a significant amount of time. They need to mature in the mind of the Product Manager, to be the best window into the bigger picture.
That’s why I see the IPM as a moment of birth: after the story is discussed and pointed, it is ready to go and live its life in “the real world”!



Writing user stories is more complex than it seems, at least that’s what I have learned and observed
