I have started my journey as a Product Manager just over a year ago.
That first year has been a collection of moments that I’m really grateful for:

- I have been part of a consulting engagement with one of our clients.
Being a Product Manager, in the context of consulting work, has been the occasion to learn many lessons.

- After that project, I have spent a few weeks shadowing some of my fellow PMs at Pivotal. It brought me a fresh perspective on what I had internalised as a young Product Manager.

The combination of these experiences made me see that a few of my practices are becoming new areas of improvement.
There is one that I want to keep on exploring: user stories.


### User stories and backlog ###
I see the backlog as the skeleton of a product, and the user stories are to me the vertebrae to this structure. They help articulate our high level vision.

A story is a channel of communication:

- it builds the essential, shared understanding needed between the PM and the engineers.
- it is a vehicle of transparency: each story is a *window into the product*, that stakeholders, and people outside of the core team, can open at any time.


### Structure ###
At this stage of my journey, I'm coming to the conclusion that some key elements of a user story's structure stand out:

1. The “Why”:
	It is important to have this at the top of the story. I see it as a *value statement* that helps understand the solution we aim to bring.
	This statement should be short, and keep in mind our end user (or persona):
	```"As [persona]"
			I can [what]
			So that I can [why, goal]
	```
	Having this top section gives a sense of purpose to each story.

2. The use of scenarios:
	This segment helps *define the scope of a story*.
	The scenarios are part of the acceptance criteria. If a story is ready for acceptance, then the user should be able to do, step by step, what is described in the scenario.
	The structure is often as follows:
	```
	Scenario (1, 2,...)
	Given []
	When []
	Then []
	```
	I realise the importance and value of this section: having specific, detailed scenarios leaves much less room for misunderstandings between all the people involved with a product. It is a clear reference point.

3. The use of notes:
	Notes are allowed! I used to put notes in a comment section, way below the space dedicated to the "official story". If constructive, I realise they can be as important as the sections above.
	Notes can give elements of context around each story. They can sum up various team discussions, and bring another layer of understanding.


### Around the story ###
At EngineerBetter, we are Agile to the core.
- Regardless of projects, we use the IPM as a dedicated space to finalise stories, collectively.
The discussion ignited during this scrum ritual is a way to ensure that the whole team (PM, engineers,…) is on the same page.
Writing stories takes a significant amount of time. They need to mature in the mind of the Product Manager, to be the best window into the bigger picture.
- That’s why I see the IPM as a moment of birth: after the story is discussed and pointed, it is ready to go and live its life in “the real world”!


Writing user stories is complex. From what I have learned and observed, a good structure is what will give meaning to each of them.
On the journey that is product development, each story is a step further in the direction of our North star: the product we are dedicated to build.
