I have started my journey as a Product Manager just over a year ago.
That first year has been a collection of moments that I’m really grateful for:

- I have been part of a consulting engagement with one of our clients.
Being a Product Manager in the context of consulting work has been the occasion to learn many lessons, on various levels.

- After that project, I have spent a few weeks shadowing some of my fellow PMs at Pivotal. It brought me a fresh perspective on what I had internalised as a young PM.

The combination of these experiences made me see that a few of my practices are becoming new areas of improvement.
One of them catches my attention: the user story.


### User stories and backlog ###
I see the backlog as the skeleton of a product, and the user stories are to me the vertebrae to this structure. They help articulate our high level vision

A story is a channel of communication:

- it builds the essential, shared understanding needed between the PM and the engineers.
- it is a vehicle of transparency: each story is a window into the product, that stakeholders and people outside of the core team can open at any time.


### Structure ###
At this stage of my journey, I'm coming to the conclusion that some key elements of a user story's structure stand out:

- The “Why”:
	It is important to write it at the top. It is the *value statement of the story*, and helps understand the solution it will bring. It's a good reminder. It gives a sense of purpose to each story
	This top section puts the persona first, as the whole team should never forget the end user and

-  The use of scenarios:
	A scenario is the use case
	I start appreciating the value of this section: having specific scenarios leaves much less room for misunderstanding,
	It also helps *define the scope of a story* precisely.

- The use of notes:
	Notes are allowed! I used to put notes in a comment section, way below the finished story. I realise they can be as important as the acceptance criteria and scenarios.
	Notes can give a view over the context of a story. They can sum up various team discussions or   of the Product Manager.


### Around the story ###
At EngineerBetter, we are Agile to the core.
- We use the IPMs as a dedicated space to finalise stories, collectively.
The discussions ignited during these scrum rituals are a way to ensure that the whole team (PM, engineers,…) is on the same page.
Writing stories takes a significant amount of time. They need to mature in the mind of the Product Manager, to be the best window into the bigger picture.
- That’s why I see the IPM as a moment of birth: after the story is discussed and pointed, it is ready to go and live its life in “the real world”!


Writing user stories is more complex than it seems. From what I have learned and observed, a good structure and solid discussions around each of them is the   best way to  
On the journey that is product development, each story is a step further in the direction of our shared vision and [......], our North star.
